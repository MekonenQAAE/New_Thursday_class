                        <li>Add walnuts to the food processor and process until crumbly. Transfer to a mixing bowl.
                        <li>Add vegan mayonnaise, hoisin sauce, dijon mustard, garlic powder, onion powder, salt, ground black pepper, smoked paprika and liquid smoke to the mixing bowl.
                        <li>Add cooked couscous and vital wheat gluten.
                        <li>Stir until slightly mixed and then get in there with your hands and form it into a big ball and knead it 20-30 times so that the vital wheat gluten can activate.
                        <li>Divide the burger mix into four sections and form each section into a burger shape. You can form them into a burger shape with your hands or by patting it down into a round cutter to make a flat round patty shape.
                        <li>Heat olive oil in a pan and when hot, add the burgers. Brush on vegan BBQ sauce as they cook.
